            Human activities contribute to global warming by increasing the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect 
            happens when certain gases—known as greenhouse gases—collect in Earth’s atmosphere. These gases, which occur 
            naturally in the atmosphere, include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and fluorinated gases sometimes 
            known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
            <br><br>
            Greenhouse gases let the sun’s light shine onto Earth’s surface, but they trap the heat that reflects back up 
            into the atmosphere. In this way, they act like the insulating glass walls of a greenhouse. The greenhouse 
            effect keeps Earth’s climate comfortable. Without it, surface temperatures would be cooler by about 33 degrees 
            Celsius (60 degrees Fahrenheit), and many life forms would freeze.
            <br><br>           
            Since the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s and early 1800s, people have been releasing large quantities 
            of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That amount has skyrocketed in the past century. Greenhouse gas 
            emissions increased 70 percent between 1970 and 2004. Emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important 
            greenhouse gas, rose by about 80 percent during that time. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today 
            far exceeds the natural range seen over the last 650,000 years.</p></div>

            Most of the carbon dioxide that people put into the atmosphere comes from burning fossil fuels such as oil, 
            coal, and natural gas. Cars, trucks, trains, and planes all burn fossil fuels. Many electric power plants also 
            burn fossil fuels.
            <br><br>         
            Another way people release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is by cutting down forests. This happens for two 
            reasons. Decaying plant material, including trees, releases tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
            Living trees absorb carbon dioxide. By diminishing the number of trees to absorb carbon dioxide, the gas 
            remains in the atmosphere.
            <br><br>
            Most methane in the atmosphere comes from livestock farming, landfills, and fossil fuel production such as coal 
            mining and natural gas processing. Nitrous oxide comes from agricultural technology and fossil fuel burning.
            <br><br>
            Fluorinated gases include chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. These 
            greenhouse gases are used in aerosol cans and refrigeration.
            <br><br>
            All of these human activities add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, trapping more heat than usual and 
            contributing to global warming.
