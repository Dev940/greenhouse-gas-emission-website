    <h1 id="top">How Do We Reduce Greenhouse Gases?</h1>

    <h3 class="heading">Use less electricity</h3>
    <p class="para">Taking steps to use less electricity, especially when it comes from burning coal or gas, can take a 
        big bite out of greenhouse gas emissions. Worldwide, electricity use is responsible for a quarter of all emissions. 
        <br><br>
        Some steps that you can take to use less electricity are simple and save money, like replacing incandescent light 
        bulbs with LED bulbs that use less electricity, adding insulation to your home, and setting the thermostat lower 
        in the winter and higher in the summer, especially when no one is home. There are also new technologies that help 
        keep buildings energy efficient, such as glass that reflects heat, low-flow water fixtures, smart thermostats, 
        and new air conditioning technology with refrigerants that don’t cause warming. In urban and suburban 
        environments, green or cool roofs can limit the amount of heat that gets into buildings during hot days and help 
        decrease the urban heat island effect.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Generate electricity without emissions</h3>
    <p class="para">Renewable energy sources include solar energy, geothermal energy, wind turbines, ocean wave and tidal 
        energy, waste and biomass energy, and hydropower. Because they do not burn fossil fuels, these renewable energy 
        sources do not release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as they generate electricity. Nuclear energy also 
        creates no greenhouse gas emissions, so it can be thought of as a solution to climate change. However, it does 
        generate radioactive waste that needs long-term, secure storage.
        <br><br>
        Today, the amount of electricity that comes from renewable energy is growing. A few countries, such as Iceland 
        and Costa Rica, now get nearly all of their electricity from renewable energy. In many other countries, the 
        percentage of electricity from renewable sources is currently small (5 - 10%) but growing</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Shrink the footprint of food</h3>
    <p class="para">Today, about a fifth of global carbon emissions come from raising farm animals for meat. For example, 
        as cattle digest food they burp, releasing methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and their manure releases the 
        greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. And forests, which take carbon dioxide out of the air, are often 
        cut down so that cattle have space to graze.
        <br><br>
        Eating a diet that is mostly or entirely plant-based (such as vegetables, bread, rice, and beans) lowers emissions. 
        According to the Drawdown Project, if half the population worldwide adopts a plant-rich diet by 2050, 65 gigatons of 
        carbon dioxide would be kept out of the atmosphere over about 30 years. (For a sense of scale, 65 gigatons of carbon 
        dioxide is nearly two-years-worth of recent emissions from fossil fuels and industry.) Reducing food waste can make 
        an even larger impact, saving about 90 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over 30 years.<br>
        Eating a plant-rich diet lowers greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Travel without making greenhouse gases</h3>
    <p class="para">Most of the ways we have to get from place to place currently rely on fossil fuels: gasoline for vehicles 
        and jet fuel for planes. Burning fossil fuels for transportation adds up to 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions 
        worldwide. We can reduce emissions by shifting to alternative technologies that either don’t need gasoline 
        (like bicycles and electric cars) or don’t need as much (like hybrid cars). Using public transportation, carpooling, 
        biking, and walking leads to fewer vehicles on the road and less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Cities and 
        towns can make it easier for people to lower greenhouse gas emissions by adding bus routes, bike paths, and 
        sidewalks.Electric bicycles can be a way to get around without burning gasoline.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Reduce emissions from industry</h3>
    <p class="para">Manufacturing, mining for raw materials, and dealing with the waste all take energy. Most of the products 
        that we buy — everything from phones and TVs to clothing and shoes — are created in factories, which produce up to 
        about 20% of the greenhouse gases emitted worldwide.
        <br><br>
        There are ways to decrease emissions from manufacturing. Using materials that aren’t made from fossil fuels and 
        don’t release greenhouse gases is a good start. For example, cement releases carbon dioxide as it hardens, but there 
        are alternative products that don’t create greenhouse gases. Similarly, bioplastics made from plants are an 
        alternative to plastics that come from fossil fuels. Companies can also use renewable energy sources to power 
        factories and ship the products that they create in fuel-saving cargo ships.</p>


    <h3 class="heading">Take carbon dioxide out of the air</h3>
    <p class="para">Along with reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that we add to the air, we can also take action to 
        increase the amount of carbon dioxide we take out of the air. The places where carbon dioxide is pulled out of 
        the air are called carbon sinks. For example, planting trees, bamboo, and other plants increases the number of 
        carbon sinks. Conserving forests, grasslands, peatlands, and wetlands, where carbon is held in plants and soils, 
        protects existing carbon sinks. Farming methods such as planting cover crops and crop rotation keep soils healthy 
        so that they are effective carbon sinks. There are also carbon dioxide removal technologies, which may be able 
        to pull large amounts of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.As the trees and other plants in a forest use 
        sunlight to create the food they need, they are also pulling carbon dioxide out of the air.</p>
