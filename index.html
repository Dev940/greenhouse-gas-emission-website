                What is Greenhouse gas emissions?
              </h3>

              <p class="ourStory__text">
                Greenhouse gas emissions refer to the release of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, which 
                traps heat in the atmosphere and leads to global warming. The most common greenhouse gases include carbon 
                dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases.
                <br><br>
                These gases are released from a variety of human activities, including burning fossil fuels 
                (coal, oil, and gas) for energy, transportation, and industrial processes, as well as deforestation, 
                agriculture, and waste disposal.
                <br><br>
                Greenhouse gas emissions have significant impacts on the environment, including rising temperatures, 
                changing weather patterns, rising sea levels, and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as 
                droughts, floods, and storms. To mitigate the effects of climate change, it is important to reduce 
                greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy sources, 
                improving energy efficiency, and reducing waste.
